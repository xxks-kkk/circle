1.  The internal entry structure using json. When "view the entry"
    the json information will be populated into specified file format.
    When "create a new entry" with `-f | --file` option supplemented,
    technical diffculty is that I need to find a way to
        1.1 check the integrity of the file format. This prevents user
            from accidentally or intentionally modifying the pre-defined
            file format
        1.2 parse the file back into json structure. This can be a Technical
            diffculty, and further research is needed. 
                1.2.1 How to parse a file into json?
                1.2.1 what file format allows less effort to parse?

2.  File structure of the entry also needs to consider. For now, the default structure
    will be by tag. But this is subject to change.
