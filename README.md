# circle
A code snippet management tool that meant to be extreme lightweight, powerful, and portable

## Why circle?
This is a hobby project when I started my career as a *professional* programmer at IBM. I should have but never used a code snippet management tool before, and I think it is time to develop my own code base in order to improve work efficiency. I tired some code snippet management tools but I was bugged out by their program size, GUI, and incapibility to meet my needs. So, I want to develop one on my own, and at the same time, hone my programming skills.

## What is target for circle?

Circle is a code snippet management tool that designed to work under UNIX-like system. It will *NOT* provide any GUI, and meant to be used under terminal. 

The incomplete feature list includes:

- Auto line count about source code files, it will provide statistics to give you some stuff to brag about on the resume:
      
    shell: 2500L
    python: 3000L
